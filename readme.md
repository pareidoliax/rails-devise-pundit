# Xander Labels
This is a [demo app](https://xander-labels.herokuapp.com/) hosted on Heroku.

It demonstrates a simple many to many relation in Rails. The app has users and labels. Multiple labels can be applied to a user.

This app was built on a [Rails Devise Pundit Template](https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-devise-pundit) from the [RailsApps Project](http://railsapps.github.io/).
